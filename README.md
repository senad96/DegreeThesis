# TirocinioLaurea
Integrator that models 2 physical systems and performs different simulations with different numerical algorithms.
The code is organized in several files, each of which implements an algorithm (algoritmo_Eulero.py, algoritmo_RK4.py, algoritmo_Verlet.py ). From 'params_pendolo' and 'params_satellite' files you can
set system parameters and from file evolve.py you can (by choosing the algorithm) simulate systems.

To read the final report and to have more details open the file 'Relazione_finale.pdf' (in Italian).

# TirocinioLaurea
Integrator that models 2 physical systems and performs different simulations with different numerical algorithms.
the code is organized in several files, each of which implements an algorithm. From 'params_pendolo' and 'params_satellite' files you can
set system parameters and from file evolve you can (by choosing the algorithm) simulate systems.

To read the final report open the file 'Relazione.pdf' (in Italian).
